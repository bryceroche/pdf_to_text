  1. axf:output-volume-info
First, axf:output-volume-info(extended element) is needed. The axf:output-volume-info
is placed as a child of fo:root. If it comes before fo:page-sequence appears, it is possible to
put it in an arbitrary position under a child of fo:root.
<axf:output-volume-info
  initial-volume-number="2"
  format="-1"
  bookmark-include="separate"
/>
<fo:page-sequence>
  PAGE-SEQUENCE-1
  ...
</fo:page-sequence>
<fo:page-sequence>
  PAGE-SEQUENCE-2
  ...
</fo:page-sequence>
<fo:page-sequence axf:output-volume-break="true">
  PAGE-SEQUENCE-3
  ...
</fo:page-sequence>

Effective only when outputting to files. It’s not available for printing or stream output.
At that time the file name should be given by GUI, command line parameter or etc. The file
names of separate volumes are given automatically based on the output file names. This
process is done by inputting the strings formatted by the format property right before the
file extension of the output file name. In the above example, when document.pdf is given
to  the  file  name,  PAGE-SEQUENCE-1  and  PAGE-SEQUENCE-2  are  outputted  to
document-2.pdf, PAGE-SEQUENCE-3 is outputted to document-3.pdf.

The numeric value applied to the format property can be given by the axf:initial-volume-
number property as the initial value. The format property is the same as "7.24.1. format" in
the XSL-FO specification.

The volume is separated by the axf:output-volume-break property specified to fo:page-
sequence.  If  the  axf:output-volume-filename  property  is  specified,  only  the  separated
volumes can be outputted with the specified file name.

The book mark of PDF in multi separate volume can be set by the axf:bookmark-include

from the following options.
・ Adds a bookmark to the first separate volume only.
・ Adds bookmarks to all the separate volumes.
